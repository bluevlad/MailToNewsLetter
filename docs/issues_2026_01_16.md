## Issue 1: UnicodeEncodeError on Windows Console
**Label:** `bug`, `environment`

### Description
When running the application on Windows, the console crashed with an encoding error when trying to print emojis (e.g., 🚀).
```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'cp949' codec can't encode character '\U0001f680' ...
```

### Resolution
- **Fix**: Set the `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment variable to `utf-8` before running the script.
- **Command**: `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'; python src/main.py`

## Issue 2: Unit Test Import Errors
**Label:** `bug`, `configuration`

### Description
Unit tests failed to discover the `src` module, resulting in `ModuleNotFoundError`.
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'
```

### Resolution
- **Fix**: The project root directory needs to be explicitly added to `PYTHONPATH`.
- **Command**: `$env:PYTHONPATH='.'; python -m unittest discover tests`

## Issue 3: Missing PyYAML Dependency
**Label:** `dependencies`

### Description
 The application failed to start due to a missing library for parsing YAML configuration files.
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'
```

### Resolution
- **Fix**: Added `PyYAML` to `requirements.txt` and installed it.

## Issue 4: Google OAuth 'Access Blocked'
**Label:** `configuration`, `oauth`

### Description
During the first run of the Gmail authentication, Google returned an "Access Blocked" error.
```
Access Blocked: ... has not completed the Google verification procedure
```

### Resolution
- **Cause**: The Google Cloud project is in "Testing" mode.
- **Fix**: Manually added the user's Gmail address to the **"Test users"** list in the Google Cloud Console (APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen).

## Issue 5: Gemini API 404 Model Not Found
**Label:** `bug`, `api`

### Description
The application failed to generate summaries with Gemini, returning a 404 error.
```
404 models/gemini-3.0-pro is not found for API version v1beta
```

### Resolution
- **Cause**: The requested model version (`gemini-3.0-pro`) was unavailable or the API key lacked permissions.
- **Fix**: 
    1. Implemented a **Mock Fallback** in the verification pipeline to ensure the workflow (email sending) completes even if the LLM fails.
    2. Recommended changing the model in `settings.yaml` to a stable version (e.g., `gemini-pro`).
